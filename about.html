          LMS delivers and manages all types of content, including videos,
          courses, workshops, and documents. In the education and higher
          education markets, an LMS will include a variety of functionality that
          is similar to corporate but will have features such as rubrics,
          teacher and instructor-facilitated learning, a discussion board, and
          often the use of a syllabus. A syllabus is rarely a feature in the
          corporate LMS, although courses may start with a heading-level index
          to give learners an overview of topics covered.
